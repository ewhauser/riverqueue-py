# River client for Python

An insert-only Python client for [River](https://github.com/riverqueue/river) packaged in the [`riverqueue` gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/riverqueue). Allows jobs to be inserted in Python and run by a Go worker, but doesn't support working jobs in Python.

## Development

See [development](./docs/development.md).
